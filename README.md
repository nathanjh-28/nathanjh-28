## Nathan J Harris


Iâ€™m a software developer and current computer science student with a unique background in lighting console programming for major film productions. After a successful career working with academy award winning talent, I transitioned into software development to apply my problem-solving and communication skills to new challenges. I specialize in building tools that simplify complex processes and help people focus on what matters most.

With a strong mix of technical expertise and creativity, Iâ€™ve worked on systems programming, machine learning research, and full-stack applications. Iâ€™m passionate about creating impactful software solutions and collaborating with talented teams to solve difficult problems.

As I complete my computer science studies, Iâ€™m focused on roles where I can leverage my diverse experience and technical skills to build innovative solutions for businesses and users.
