## Nathan J Harris


I am a software engineer who enjoys discovering how technologies work and optimizing them for users. I am passionate about making tools that help people with their everyday lives by stripping away obstacles that block them from what matters most. I use my background in lighting console programming to bridge the divide between people and technology.

Technologies: Python - Django - Javascript - Node - Express - React - HTML - CSS
